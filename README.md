## Hackathon BDC 2019

During this hackathon, we were tasked with building a product related to the automobile industry. Other than these instructions, we had full creative freedom to build whatever we wanted. We decided to showcase a template of a website that would be giving insights into their inventory (how much they sold, how many automobile pieces they've bought, etc) in the form of data visualizations. We also showed that there could be some machine learning integrated to forecast future variations in their inventory.
